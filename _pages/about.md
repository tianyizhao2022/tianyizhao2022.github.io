I'm a PhD student in the Department of Linguistics at the [University of Konstanz](https://www.uni-konstanz.de/). Currently, I work as a doctoral researcher for the DFG-AHRC project <i>Prosodic structure at the interface between language and speech</i> (supervised by [Tina Bögel](https://ling.sprachwiss.uni-konstanz.de/pages/home/boegel/) and [Alice Turk](https://www.ed.ac.uk/profile/alice-turk)).

I'm interested in experimental linguistics with the focus on prosody, tone and intonation as well as phonetics and phonology in general.

✍️

I received my Master degree in Germanic Linguistics at the University of Konstanz. Back then, I worked for projects on second language acquisition, interaction between tone and intonation and some corpus research in Middle Low German.

For my undergraduate degree, I studied German language and literature at [Beijing Foreign Studies University](https://en.bfsu.edu.cn/) (China).
