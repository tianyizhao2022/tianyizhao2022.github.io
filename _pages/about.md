I'm a PhD student in the Department of Linguistics at the [University of Konstanz](https://www.uni-konstanz.de/). Currently, I work as a doctoral researcher for the DFG-AHRC project <i>Prosodic structure at the interface between language and speech</i> (supervised by [Tina BÃ¶gel](https://ling.sprachwiss.uni-konstanz.de/pages/home/boegel/) and [Alice Turk](https://www.ed.ac.uk/profile/alice-turk)).
